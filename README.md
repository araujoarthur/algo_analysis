# Algorithm Analysis

Initially this repository was intended to hold only my CS161 (recorded classes by Tim Roughgarden) stuff, but I ended up extending it to hold some code that I will one day document and analyze.

## Implemented Algorithms (by insertion order)

| Algorithm Name | Finished | Analyzed/Published | Optimized |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Karatsuba  | Y | Y/N | N |
| Merge Sort     | Y | N/N | N |

## Implemented Data Structures (by insertion order)

| Algorithm Name | Finished | Analyzed/Published | Optimized |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Dynamic List (aka Lista com Arranjo)  | Y | Y/N | N |
